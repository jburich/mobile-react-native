- Notes
* If you suddenly get a "Cannot read 'error' from null" error message it sucks. 
** Sometimes a reboot of the app or the server will fix it, other times it takes a bunch of debugging to find ethe problem.
** More often this is just a syntax error in the file that it says and you have to hunt it down
